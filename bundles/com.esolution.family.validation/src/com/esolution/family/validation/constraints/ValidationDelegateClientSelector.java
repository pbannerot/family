	//NOTE: This is _NOT_ a recommended approach to writing a client selector.
	//Suggested approaches:
	//  -Check the resource of the EObject either by identity or by URI
	//   as long as this resource is somehow unique to this application
	//  -Check the identity of the resource set to ensure that it is some
	//   private object
	//  -Check the identity of the EObject itself to see if it belongs to
	//   some private collection
	//  -Check the EClass of the EObject but only if the metamodel is private
	//   to this application and will not be used by other contexts
